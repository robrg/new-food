            <p id = "workoutinfo">Welcome to my Workout page, i am currently in the beginner bracket of training so if you are an intermediate/ experienced lifter then these workouts will probably not be for you. But feel free to take them and add 1 or 2 more exercises of choice on top.<br><br>I currently do a 2 Muscle group split over 6 days, incase you dont know what this is an example would be as follows, so one day i will train Chest and Shoulders and then the next day i would train Legs and Back ect. You can change these 2 muscle groups around to best suit you but this is just how i like to train, training should be fun for you so dont follow a workout routine that you dont enjoy.<br><br>I am not a personal trainer and these are just my opions done from doing research so do what you will with this advice, if you want to train to failure every set then go for it, but i prefer to train for volume over a longer period of time. So enough of my pseudo trainer talk, here is what a week of working out looks like for me.</p>

        <p id = "lastdesc">So there you have it, that is my training programme that i follow every week. I repeat the day 1-3 cycle on the 4th day, so i have plenty of time to rest those muscles before retraining them again. If you notice i do 5 exercises per workout, i will usualy rotate the last exercise on the 2nd cycle of the 3 day split. To explain this abit better you see on day 2 i did 3 biceps exercises, so on day 5 i will switch out that last exercise for a tricep exercise instead to even it out. So just to clarify i am not a personal trainer and this is just my own made training plan for my own goals, always consult a personal trainer to help avoid injuries and under/over training.</p>
